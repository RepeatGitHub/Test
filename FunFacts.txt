The intrepretation of Vinki in this mod is slightly different from the one from any official Vinki content by OlayColay. (His official reference sheet is at https://artfight.net/character/3448140.the-vinki-slugcat.) Here's a few differences:

- He struggles a bit with going too far with things, which is shown in the (upcoming planned) dialogue changes.
- Since he's in something very similar to the real world, he HAS learned how to read and write in English. He's somehow quite good at getting the grammar correct, too.
- He's a little less likely to spray paint things that are probably going to be used later, but he's more likely to paint over existing artwork.

Some extra lore:
- The intro car IS owned by him. For some reason, he always sprays it with wipe-off spray paint, so it always falls off. This time, though, he remembered to bring his regular spray cans!
- Theo did allow him to paint his tent. He loves the design!
