What's supposed to happen:

On room transition:
  If level is in hasArtSpots:
    Set Session.artSpots to artSpots[index]
  For each existing texture that can be replaced via art spots:
    If that texture has been replaced (thanks to the settings):
      Replace the texture using GUI.Game[]=GUI.Game=[]
    Else:
      Un-replace the texture
On each game tick:
  If Session.artSpots exists and player has Vinki skin on:
    For each spot in Session.artSpots:
      If the player is colliding with the coordinates of the art spot and player hasn't used that art spot:
        Display the graffiti indicator
        If the player just pressed the graffiti button:
          Replace the texture using GUI.Game[]=GUI.Game=[]
          Set the settings to reflect this (so that later line 7 shows as true)

What actually happens:
- Intro car works
- big_sign_b only shows as replaced
- The rest either don't work or only show as replaced
